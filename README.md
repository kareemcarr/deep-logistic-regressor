r# deep-logistic-regressor
This repository is created in partial fulfillment of [BMI 707](https://hms-dbmi.github.io/BMI_707/). The goal is to create a deep neural network that can function as an engine in a stepwise regression algorithm. The task is to progressively analyze aspects of model fit and use these to determine the next step in modifying the model in order to improve predictive performance. The data will be simulated and thus we will have perfect information about the best model. I hope to discover the features of model fit that would be most salient for producing the best model and if time permits a comparison to rules of thumb from statistical literature will be made.
